Activity Classic

Description

The Activity Classic watch face combines the simplicity and readability of an analogue watch dial with the activity tracking capabilities of the fenix 3.

Features include:

- Top left quadrant:- Green/Orange/Red arc shows battery charge status.

- Top right quadrant:- Arc which shows count of unread notifications.  It's easy to miss the first notification, so the first notification appears as a large bar between 1-5 minutes.  Each subsequent notification appears as an additional 1 minute segment.  The arc can be disabled and colour can be selected in the watch settings.    

- Bottom right quadrant:- Blue arc shows steps indicating progress towards daily goal.

- Bottom left quadrant:- Red arc shows move bar: triggered when it is time to move.

- Optional UTC hand with large circle and configurable highlight colour
     
- Optional moon phase indicator in place of numeral 6 or 9.

- Configurable second-hand style (arrow or pointer).

- Switch between simple and advanced display using the 12/24hour system time setting. (The battery and steps icons are hidden in 12 hour mode).

- Triangle at 12 o'clock indicates phone connection status: A blue triangle when the phone is connected and a red exclamation mark when disconnected.

- Smart date placement: Date moves to 9 O'clock positition to avoid being obscured when hands are at 3 O'clock.

- Second hand is displayed when watch enters high power mode (as with all watch faces this is under control of the the watch which switches modes automatically when it detects gestures - see https://forums.garmin.com/showthread.php?300514-Watch-hands-disappear-after-10-seconds).
